## Project Overview
This project is about training a deep learning model on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. It can be, for example,used as a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:<br/>
1. Load and preprocess the image dataset<br/>
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset<br/>
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content
